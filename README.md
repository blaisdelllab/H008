Insight is marked by a sudden realization or "aha!" moment after rethinking a problem in a novel way. Despite its relevance, the impact of external factors like caffeine on insight problem-solving remains underexplored. This study recruited participants to solve spatial, mathematical, and verbal insight problems after reporting their daily and chronic caffeine consumption. Participants' responses, accuracy, and solution times were tracked and evaluated using a large language model pipeline trained to evaluate responses and provide automated feedback in real time. Previous research suggests that habitual caffeine consumption may hinder insight problem-solving by fostering over-arousal, while acute consumption may improve performance due to enhanced attention. Future studies should experimentally manipulate caffeine intake to examine its acute and chronic effects on insight, while also exploring the role of caffeine delivery methods and individual tolerance levels.
